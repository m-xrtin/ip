# Tarnia

Tarnia is a simple command-line task manager application. It helps users keep track of different kinds of tasks such as **todos**, **deadlines**, and **events**, while allowing you to mark tasks as done, unmark them, and manage your task list interactively.

## Features
- Add three types of tasks:
  - **Todo** – a basic task with just a description.
  - **Deadline** – a task with a description and a due date.
  - **Event** – a task with a description and a date/time for when it occurs.
- List all tasks with their completion status.
- Mark and unmark tasks as done.
- Delete tasks you no longer need.
- Search for tasks using keywords.
- Save and load tasks automatically between sessions.
